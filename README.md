## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

â€¢ A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
â€¢ Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
â€¢ Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
â€¢ Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
â€¢ Market price tracking.
â€¢ Voice support for low-literate users.
â€¢ Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

â€¢ Small and marginal farmers
â€¢ Agricultural extension officers
â€¢ Government agriculture departments
â€¢ NGOs and cooperatives
â€¢ Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

â€¢ 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
â€¢ Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20â€“30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
I propose a multilingual, AI-powered advisory platform (mobile app/chatbot) that integrates government data, machine learning, and farmer-friendly interfaces to deliver personalized, real-time crop guidance.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Real-time, Location-specific Advisory

What it does:

Uses GPS + government soil datasets + weather APIs to recommend crops suited for a farmerâ€™s land.

Provides sowing schedules, irrigation planning, and seasonal guidance.

Problem it solves:

Farmers no longer rely on guesswork or shopkeeper suggestions.

Ensures crops are chosen scientifically, improving yield and reducing risk.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Soil Health & Fertilizer Guidance

What it does:

Integrates soil health data (from Soil Health Card scheme / ICAR).

Suggests correct type & amount of fertilizer (organic + chemical).

Problem it solves:

Prevents overuse of fertilizers, lowering costs and reducing soil degradation.

Promotes balanced nutrient management â†’ healthier crops & sustainable farming.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Weather-based Alerts & Predictions

What it does:

Pulls real-time weather data + predictive analytics.

Sends alerts for rainfall, droughts, floods, and pest-prone conditions.

Problem it solves:

Helps farmers plan irrigation and sowing at the right time.

Reduces crop loss due to unexpected weather events.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Pest & Disease Detection via Image Uploads

What it does:

Farmers upload a photo of a diseased crop.

An ML-based image recognition model detects pests/diseases.

Provides immediate treatment recommendations (eco-friendly + chemical).

Problem it solves:

Eliminates dependency on local, unreliable advice.

Enables early detection of crop diseases â†’ higher survival rate.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Market Price Tracking

What it does:

Fetches real-time mandi (market) prices from Agmarknet and other government portals.

Shows best markets nearby for selling produce.

Problem it solves:

Farmers can maximize profit by selling crops at the right time and place.

Reduces exploitation by middlemen.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Multilingual & Voice Support

What it does:

Available in multiple Indian languages.

Voice-based queries and answers for farmers with low literacy.

Problem it solves:

Overcomes language barriers and digital literacy issues.

Makes advanced tech accessible to every farmer, even those who canâ€™t read.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Feedback & Continuous Learning

What it does:

Farmers can provide feedback on whether advice worked.

System refines recommendations using AI over time.

Problem it solves:

Keeps the system relevant and farmer-centric.
Builds trust by adapting to local realities.

<h3>How AgriMate Assistant Addresses the Problem</h3>

Problem: Farmers rely on guesswork or shopkeepers for crop decisions.
Solution: Location & soil-based crop advisory.
Impact: Scientific, personalized recommendations â†’ higher yields and lower crop failure risk.

Problem: Excessive fertilizer use increases cost and damages soil.
Solution: Fertilizer guidance model.
Impact: Optimized type & amount â†’ reduces input costs and maintains soil health.

Problem: Crops are lost due to pests and diseases.
Solution: Pest/disease detection via photo uploads.
Impact: Early identification & treatment â†’ prevents crop damage.

Problem: Weather uncertainties cause crop loss.
Solution: Weather alerts & predictive insights.
Impact: Helps plan irrigation, sowing, and harvesting â†’ reduces risk of crop failure.

Problem: Low literacy and language barriers prevent access to tech.
Solution: Multilingual & voice-based interface.
Impact: Farmers understand guidance easily â†’ broad adoption.

Problem: Farmers sell at low prices due to market ignorance.
Solution: Real-time market price tracking.
Impact: Enables better selling decisions â†’ increases income.

Problem: Advisory systems are static and donâ€™t adapt to local conditions.
